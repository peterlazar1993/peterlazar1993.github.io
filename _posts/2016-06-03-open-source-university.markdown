Landing a programming job is not as hard as it used to be. There are numerous bootcamps and online resources that you don’t really need a college education in Computer Science to become industry ready. Take me for instance, I do not have a CS degree but landed a pretty good(read awesome) gig straight out of college. But does that mean that you don’t need to know what the CS grads know? Absolutely not. I’ve always had this nagging notion in my head that I am missing something. Well I finally decided to do something about it. Enter [Open Source University][1].

> MIT Level undergraduate CS curriculum, for free.

It is a collection of MOOCs that you take sequentially. They are taught by professors from world renowned universities like MIT, Harvard and Stanford. Even if you think that you don’t need a formal education in CS, take these courses for the lectures for the sake of learning. Some of these lectures are fun and will probably be one of the most engaging educational experiences you have ever had.

> As of now there are 37 courses, without counting the specialisations.

The curriculum might appear daunting to most, but the trick is to take them one by one, sequentially. They also recommend on taking the [Learning How to Learn][2] MOOC so that you can employ the best learning techniques that works for you.
I have started the first course Introduction to Computer Science - CS50 almost thrice from the year they started offering it online, but dropped off around the 3 week mark. This in no terms speaks about the course itself. I think CS50 is a phenomenal course and the best intro to CS you can have. It’s the lack of deliberate effort to do the coursework and put in time that caused me to drop off. Hopefully I will overcome those and soldier on through the curriculum.

Stay tuned to here about my progress and what I learn from these courses.
